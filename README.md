# Noisy, Liquid Brain Simulation

An agent based implementation of density classification. The model allows for
imperfect sensing of other agents states and repeated polling of specific agents.
This implementation also allows agents, at each time step, to alter their current heading
by randomly veering left or right 45 degrees, leading to a correlated random walk,
or to follow an uncorrelated random walk by choosing any new heading uniformly at random.
